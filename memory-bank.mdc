      MEMORY BANK PROTOCOL

      **CRITICAL**: Memory bank files are the ONLY resource available after session reset. 
      Agent must understand EVERYTHING just by reading these files. No other context exists.

      **REQUIRED FILES** (memory-bank/):
      1. `projectbrief.md` - Core requirements and scope
      2. `productContext.md` - What this solves and user goals  
      3. `activeContext.md` - Current focus and next steps
      4. `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and key decisions
      5. `techContext.md` - Technologies and constraints
      6. `progress.md` - Status and known issues
      7. `view.md` - Architecture diagrams
      8. `[filename].md` - For each code file explanation

      **WORKFLOW**:
      - Start: Read ALL memory bank files
      - Work: Update documentation after changes
      - Cleanup: Remove outdated info, keep minimal

      **UPDATE TRIGGERS**:
      - New project patterns discovered
      - After significant changes  
      - User says "update memory bank"
      - Context needs clarification

      **BREVITY RULE**: 
      - Each file as brief as possible
      - 1 sentence better than 100
      - Clean out outdated info
      - No unnecessary details

examples:
  - input: "update memory bank"
    output: "Review ALL files, update current state, remove outdated info"
